We have implemented Inclusive and Exclusive cache inclusion policies over the default Non-Inclusive policy. Also we tested our code for different cache sizes by varying the number of sets. They can be checked using the bash script 'cache_size.sh'. 

It takes 4 arguments 'L1D-sets L2-sets LLC-sets policy'. Replace policy with 1 for inclusive, 2 for exclusive and 3 for non-inclusive. After running this bash script, run the champsim as usual and it will work according to the specifications.
